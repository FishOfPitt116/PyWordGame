# PyWordGame

A simple four-letter word typing game to help anyone with cognitive disabilities learn how to type!

## Current Features:
- Set of 100+ four letter words chosen from randomly
- On correct letter typed, letter is highlighted green to imply next letter should be typed
- On incorrect letter typed, word "resets"
- On correct word typed, a random reward sound is played from a series of options

## Future Desired Features
- More words to randomly choose from
- Different length words, a setting to be able to choose this
- Ability to download custom reward sounds
- Option to have a buzzer sound on missed word
- Fireworks or other animations on reward in addition to sound
- Custom backgrounds/colors
- Further customization to allow for more flexibility with settings

I'd love to hear feedback on what can be done to better the game for those using it! Let me know if there are any recommendations for new
features or modifications. Thanks!! - Robbie
